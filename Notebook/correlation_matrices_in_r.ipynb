    "# Seven Easy Graphs to Visualize Correlation Matrices in R\n",
    "By James Marquez, April 15, 2017\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to share seven insightful correlation matrix visualizations that are beautiful and simple to build with only one line of code. However, each graph does have many customization options for power users to explore. We'll use the built in [mtcars](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html) dataset that consists of fuel consumption and 10 variables of automobile design, such as number of cylinders, horsepower, engine displacement, etc., for 32 automobiles. We'll start by saving five variables to a new object called 'mydata'. We'll use the 'mydata' object in all our examples."
